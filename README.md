Microsoft Azure is a cloud-based platform that provides various tools and services. This guide will take you through creating an account, setting up a Windows 11 virtual machine (VM), and configuring Active Directory (AD) on a Windows Server 2019. The server will then be promoted to a domain controller (DC). Afterward, we'll join the Windows 11 VM to the domain we just created. Following that, we'll create users, organizational units (OUs), groups, and demonstrate how to add a user to a security group or OU.

What is Active Directory? Active Directory is like the phone book for a computer network. It contains a list of users, computers, and groups, ensuring everyone can find and access the right information. It's the organizational backbone of your network. 

What is a Domain Controller? The Domain Controller is a vital server that manages security and access in a network. It holds Active Directory, which keeps track of users, computers, and permissions. The Domain Controller authenticates users, allowing or denying access to network resources based on predefined rules. It acts as the control center, ensuring a secure and organized network environment.
